<!-- Reproducibility reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects. These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

*\[No abstract is needed.\] Each reproducibility project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and reproducibility results. These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole. Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of your attempt to reproduce the results. Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for your reproducibility attempt, and any other essential information. It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.*

**Clarify key analysis of interest here:**

### Justification for choice of study

My current line of research focuses on individual differences in early information seeking. To study infant learning strategies, Poli and colleagues (2020; 2024) have developed an analytic pipeline that leverages an infant-friendly visual learning (VL) task from which information-theoretic measures (e.g., **predictability and information gain**) can be derived for each trial in sequences of visual events.

These measures are then incorporated into a hierarchical Bayesian model fitted to real infants' looking behavior (look-aways, looking time, and saccadic latency) in the VL task to infer the values of latent parameters that represent specific cognitive functions: **processing speed**, **learning performance**, **curiosity**, and **sustained attention** (see Figure 1).

[![Figure 1. The research pipeline in Poli et al. 2024 (Figure 2 in the original paper). The current project will focus on the first three boxes outlined in yellow: (1) reproducing the information-theoretic measures from the stimuli in the visual learning task, (2) simulating infant eye-tracking data during the VL task, and (3) estimating the latent parameters at the individual level.](images/poli2024researchpipeline-01.jpg)](https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.13460)

For the proposed project, I have three primary aims:

**(1)** Derive the information-theoretic measures, predictability and information gain, from the stimuli in the visual learning task.

**(2)** Simulate pre-processed infant looking behavior (not trial-by-trial gaze data) in the visual learning task, specifically saccadic latency and looking time.

**(3)** Fit a hierarchical Bayesian model at the individual level to estimate my latent parameter of interest: learning performance.

**(4)** Compare the analysis on the simulated data to the original data (Poli et al., 2024).

Working through the described pipeline will help me develop the analytic toolkit and computational understanding needed for my own research program.

### Anticipated challenges

Simulating this data and analytic pipeline involves three high-level stages: input generation, hierarchical modeling, and outcome replication, each of which will pose their own computational challenges.

Thanks to the generosity of the original authors, the code to generate the sequences for the visual learning task is publicly available. I will follow Poli et al. (2020 and 2024) to attempt to derive the information-theoretic measures for each trial in the visual learning task. This may be complex and time-consuming to undertake from scratch given the scope of the current project. In the event that Step 1 hinders the completion of the subsequent step, I will reference the original analysis script, found [here](https://data.ru.nl/collections/di/dcc/DSC_2019.00056_127), or reach out to the original authors for code clarification.

To estimate individual differences in learning performance, the authors related infants' saccadic latencies (SL) to how predictable each visual event in a sequence was, and whether this relationship differed across infants. They derived how predictable the sequence was at any given trial in the visual learning task by taking the negative entropy of the probability that the target shape would appear in a certain location. They then fit a Bayesian hierarchical regression model linking infants' saccadic latencies to sequence predictability (entropy) and used individual infants' slope estimates as a proxy for learning performance.

## Methods

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study.

### Differences from original study

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results.

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them). None of these need to be long.
